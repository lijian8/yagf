YAGF is a graphical front-end for cuneiform and tesseract OCR tools.
With YAGF you can open already scanned image files or obtain new images via XSane (scanning results are automatically passed to YAGF).
Once you have a scanned image you can prepare it for recognition, select particular image areas for recognition, set the recognition language and so on.
Recognized text is displayed in a editor window where it can be corrected, saved to disk or copied to clipboard.
YAGF also provides some facilities for a multi-page recognition (see the online help for more details).
The current release is 0.9.5 (Feb 17 2015). Main new features are project autosave, djvu import, table recognition (experimental).
